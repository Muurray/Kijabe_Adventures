Use sunscreen, hats, sunglasses, and UV-protective clothing.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Follow Your Guide’s Instructions</h2>\n<p>Your guide understands wildlife behavior and terrain. Always follow their lead.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Pack Light but Smart</h2>\n<p>Carry only essentials: water, snacks, basic first aid, and a light jacket.</p>\n\n<h2>7. Wear Neutral Colors</h2>\n<p>Earth tones help you blend into nature and avoid startling animals.</p>\n\n<h2>8. Know Your Limits</h2>\n<p>Choose hiking trails that match your fitness level and avoid overexertion.</p>\n\n<h2>9. Respect Wildlife Distance</h2>\n<p>Never approach animals. Use binoculars for safe viewing.</p>\n\n<h2>10.
